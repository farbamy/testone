Lucifer Sam, Siam cat
Always sitting by your side
Always by your side
That cat's something I can't explain
Ginger, Ginger you're a witch
You're the left side
He's the right side
Oh, no
That cat's something I can't explain
Lucifer go to sea
Be a hip cat, be a ship's cat
Somewhere, anywhere
That cat's something I can't explain
